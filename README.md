First repository

New to Github!

New to programming. Looking for a career change. Currently learning Python through Codeacademy and edx MITx introduction to programming using python course.
Hope to begin to work through FreeCodeCamp and that is why I have started a github account. 
I hope to work on projects involving language learning, music production, and anything involving soccer.
